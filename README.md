# Mandelbrot in C language with arbitrary precision

This is a proof of concept project. The main goal is do some research in order to allow zooming further than limits of double-precision in the Fractal generation software GNofract4D. More details about the feature on:

* [Official issue for the enhancement](https://github.com/fract4d/gnofract4d/issues/77)
* [Open discussion to define a roadmap for the feature](https://github.com/HyveInnovate/gnofract4d/issues/7)

Detailed explanations about the Mandelbrot Set can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

Specific goals for this proof of concept are:

* Test some different C arbitrary precision libraries.
* Performance analysis.
* Try different approaches when arbitrary precision is not needed. How to support both at the same time.

### Math

Basically, there is a mathematical basic Mandelbrot formula (for complex numbers):

```
f(x) = zÂ² + c
```

where `z` and `c` are complex number. 

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function does not diverge when iterated from z=0.
Than means, given a `c` complex number, if you apply the formula to that number `n` times using the previous result as the new `z` number, that `c` belongs to Mandelbrot Set if the sequence does not diverge.

You can represent those complex number in a graph where x-axis is the real part of the complex number and y-axis is the imaginary part.

### Drawing the fractal

It draws the portion of the graph between -2 and 2 real and imaginary parts.
Mandelbrot Set is inside those limits.

## Dev requirements

* Docker version 18.09.7

## Installation

IMPORTANT!: installation is only tested for this Ubuntu version:

```
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
Release:	18.04
Codename:	bionic
```

Install dependencies:
```
./bin/install_dependencies
```

Install app from source dir (after installing dependencies):
```
./bin/install
```

## Run

Run:
```
./bin/run
```

`run` command will create 2 files in the root dir:
* mandelbrot-256x256.ppm (Mandelbrot image)
* mandelbrot-256x256.txt (Mandelbrot ASCII version)

## Development

All commands use docker under the hood.

Setup:
```
./bin/dev_setup
```

Only compile code:
```
./bin/compile
```

Run main program:
```
./bin/dev_run
```

Execute tests:
```
./bin/test
```

Compile and run:
```
./bin/compile && ./bin/dev_run
```

## Enhancements

* Do not use arbitrary precision when it's not needed.
* Use a better color map, maybe copy from: https://github.com/josch/mandelbrot/blob/master/mandel_mpfr.c
* Improve performance with "period checking", see also from https://github.com/josch/mandelbrot/blob/master/mandel_mpfr.c

## TODO

* Get `main` arguments from console (resolution and filenames).
* Calculate dynamically needed precision.
* Allow to set a fractal tile and zoom level.
