# Mandelbrot in C language with arbitrary precision

This is a proof of concept project. The main goal is do some research in order to allow zooming further than limits of double-precision in the Fractal generation software GNofract4D. More details about the feature on:

* [Official issue for the enhancement](https://github.com/fract4d/gnofract4d/issues/77)
* [Open discussion to define a roadmap for the feature](https://github.com/HyveInnovate/gnofract4d/issues/7)

Detailed explanations about the Mandelbrot Set can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

Specific goals for this proof of concept are:

* Test some different C arbitrary precision libraries.
* Performance analysis.
* Try different approaches when arbitrary precision is not needed. How to support both at the same time.

### Math

Basically, there is a mathematical basic Mandelbrot formula (for complex numbers):

```
f(x) = zÂ² + c
```

where `z` and `c` are complex number. 

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers `c` for which the function does not diverge when iterated from z=0.
Than means, given a `c` complex number, if you apply the formula to that number `n` times using the previous result as the new `z` number, that `c` belongs to Mandelbrot Set if the sequence does not diverge.

You can represent those complex number in a graph where x-axis is the real part of the complex number and y-axis is the imaginary part.

### Drawing the fractal

It draws the portion of the graph between -2 and 2 real and imaginary parts.
Mandelbrot Set is inside those limits.

## Dev requirements

* Docker version 18.09.7

## Install

>IMPORTANT: Not tested yet. It's just a copy&paste from Dockerfile.

```
./install
```

## Development commands

All commands use docker under the hood.

Setup:
```
./dev_setup
```

Only compile code:
```
./compile
```

Run main program (it generates a ppm image and txt file with Mandelbrot fractal):
```
./run
```

Execute tests:
```
./test
```

Compile and run:
```
./compile && ./run
```
